# DnD-Helper

This is an encounter helper for DnD written in Python, with a Qt UI through PyQt. 

This is in a very messy stage right now in terms of code organization, but it works well and in the next few weeks I intend to fix/redo the code in a much more "Pythonic" way.

The DnD encounter helper was initially created as a means for a DM to have a nice resource for paying attention to encounters. You can save groups of mobs you intend to use for each encounter via exporting. Additionally you can save the state of the encounter, pausing in the middle of everything and load it up later (this should come with no surprise).


I look forward to any criticism.

In the future I intend on adding only a few things, the major one being an undo-redo feature. otherwise I want this to be simple and not build up too much complexity.
